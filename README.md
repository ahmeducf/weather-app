# Weather APP

A simple weather app that uses weatherAPI to display the current weather forecast of a city.

I started this project to practice Asynchronous JavaScript and to learn how to use APIs.

## Features

- Search for a city
- Use geolocation to get the current weather forecast of the user's location
- Auto suggest cities as the user types in the search bar
- Ability to switch between Celsius and Fahrenheit

## Demo

Try the app deployed on github pages: [Weather App](https://ahmeducf.github.io/weather-app/)

## Technologies Used

- Webpack: Module bundler
- Babel: JavaScript compiler
- Fetch API: To make HTTP requests
- Geolocation API: To get the user's current location
- Husky: To run scripts during and before commits
- Eslint: To enforce code style
- Prettier: To format code

## Acknowledgement

- [WeatherAPI](https://www.weatherapi.com/): To get the weather forecast of a city
- [date-fns](https://date-fns.org/): To format dates

## Roadmap

- [ ] Make the app responsive for mobile devices
